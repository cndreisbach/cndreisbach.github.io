<p>Last Friday, I saw the above message from my co-worker Marc come across Twitter. Of all my co-workers, Marc&#39;s the one I spend the most time talking to, and the one who knows me the best. I didn&#39;t know exactly what to think at first. It was kind of funny, and definitely correct, but I don&#39;t think of myself as this short-tempered angry guy.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not the first time I&#39;ve had this reputation, and so it&#39;s obviously well-earned. I think I&#39;ve had it at every job. One time, a guy I supervised told me I reminded him of the main character on &quot;this new television show called <em>House</em>.&quot; I&#39;d not seen it at the time, and so I asked &quot;how so?&quot; and he said, &quot;well, he&#39;s very smart and no-nonsense.&quot; The poor guy did not tell me that also he is a jerk who is abusive to the people he supervises.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to be this guy. Most jobs that I&#39;ve left, I left because I had some emotional moment where I lost my cool and then was embarrassed by it. I&#39;ve never been asked to leave a job for any reason, which is unbelievable, given that one time I stood on top of a conference room table and told someone they were an idiot. (I was much, much younger and way more hot-headed than I am now.) Even though I was never asked to leave, I left many jobs because I didn&#39;t like that people thought of me as this emotional hot-head. It&#39;s the main reason I left an incredible job at <a href="http://viget.com">Viget Labs</a> and another incredible job at <a href="http://thinkrelevance.com">Relevance</a>. It&#39;s one of the reasons the thought of leaving my current job crosses my mind often, and only my love of <a href="https://github.com/cfpb/qu/">my project</a> has kept me from seriously considering it. I started going to therapy again because I don&#39;t want to quit my job, but was going to if I didn&#39;t get control over my anger.</p>

<p>I know I&#39;m not the only person who suffers from this. I&#39;ve met lots of people in my industry, usually of the same type: a hotshot known for &quot;speaking honestly&quot; and able to get away with being a smart-ass and a jerk because they are considered a good coder. If you are this guy or girl, it&#39;s probably fun, especially if you&#39;re under 30. You definitely get a lot of good laughs. Comedy is based in transgression, and so your own breaking of social norms cracks others up.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not as fun to be this person when you&#39;re approaching 40 and have a kid you want to be a good role model for. I look at the people I most respect in my field, and they are all of another type: quiet people who are ridiculously competent but humble about it and have a quick wit. Their wit is focused on being self-deprecrating instead of lashing out. As I get older, I want to be one of these people (not least because they are the majority of people who get to remain employed in this young person&#39;s field.)</p>

<p>When I was a kid, my dad told me two things I think about a lot. One was &quot;son, you will never have a lot of friends.&quot; He meant because I think quickly and aren&#39;t at ease around other people, and he was right. It&#39;s a lot of the reason I get so angry: I don&#39;t understand why people are being what seems to me to be obtuse (but in actuality, I&#39;m not taking the time to be empathic.) The other thing was &quot;it takes a lifetime to build a good reputation and a minute to lose it.&quot; I doubt I&#39;ll ever be known as the humble friendly guy at my current job, but I&#39;m going to try. My field has enough problems without me being a jerk, too.</p>

<p><strong>Postscript</strong>: Lest Marc read this and think I didn&#39;t like his tweet, no worries. I <em>did</em> like it, and not only is it zero stretch to imagine me having that conversation, I&#39;m pretty sure I have had it. The tweet cracked me up; it also made me think.</p>
