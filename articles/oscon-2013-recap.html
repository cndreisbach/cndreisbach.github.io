  <p>I just got back from the
<a href="http://www.oscon.com/oscon2013">15th O&#39;Reilly Open Source Conference (OSCON)</a> in Portland,
Oregon. This is my fifth year going, I think, and it was as fun as
ever. This year, it was even more fun than usual because I got to see
so many friends there. I&#39;m now working at home with a distributed team
and about a dozen of us showed up and got to hang out.</p>

<div class="article-image image"><img src="/images/articles/oscon-me.jpg" alt="Me and my coworkers at OSCON" /><div class="attribution">Image of my co-workers and me by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/oreillyconf/">O'Reilly Conferences</a>.</div></div>

<p>I really like OSCON because it is a dream for generalists. Most
conferences I go to focus on a particular technology, and OSCON is
scattershot, covering anything as long as it is open-source, or
related to open-source. This year, I was particularly excited to learn about
<a href="http://www.ansibleworks.com/">Ansible</a>, <a href="http://www.oscon.com/oscon2013/public/schedule/detail/28557">3D Javascript programming</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/nathanmarz/cascalog">Cascalog</a>.</p>

<p>One very exciting thing about this year&#39;s OSCON is the expansion of
talks about human interaction. During the half-day tutorials, there
was <a href="http://blog.secretlab.com.au/2013/07/21/how-do-i-game-design/">one tutorial on game design</a>, which I attended and
thought was great., and another on using improv techniques with your
team. Even more exciting to me was
<a href="http://www.oscon.com/oscon2013/public/schedule/detail/31518">the session on depression</a>. As a life-long sufferer of
depression, I&#39;m glad any time I see it openly discussed. It has a
serious stigma about it that I think only open discussion will
alleviate.</p>

<p>While I did not get to attend the session
<a href="http://www.oscon.com/oscon2013/public/schedule/detail/29108">Bash as a Modern Programming Language</a>, the slides are
wonderful and should be of interest to anyone who is a programmer,
especially on a Unix system.</p>

<p>On Wednesday night, I facilitated a Birds of a Feather session on
roleplaying games and how they have been influenced by open
culture. It was a fun time and I met many interesting people. We
talked a lot about <a href="http://dungeon-world.com">Dungeon World</a> and the Old School Renaissance.</p>

<p>All in all, I had a great time. As always, I visited
<a href="http://www.powells.com">Powell&#39;s Books</a> and have many books to read now. Thanks to
O&#39;Reilly Media for such a great conference and I hope to see even more
friends next year. <a href="http://www.oscon.com/oscon2013/public/schedule/proceedings">Here are the slides for all the talks</a>,
which contain a wealth of knowledge.</p>
