      When you have a large program to write, you need a framework to figure out how to start. There are two major ways of figuring out how to solve a problem: top-down and bottom-up. Here are examples of how they would apply to the problem "I need to build a blackjack game."

      Last week, my spouse's beloved old white Macbook died. It lived long enough for us to use Migration Assistant, but the screen is never coming back on. We are not exactly rolling in gold coins at prompt.sh HQ, so I decided to give her my newer Macbook Pro (about 3 years old, I think, although upgraded with an SSD and 8 GB of RAM about a year ago) instead of buying a new computer.

It was organized by Julia Elman and Sarah Kahn, while Kurt Grandis developed the curriculum. All I had to do was stand in front of a room of awesome teens and teach them to program in Python all day, which was awesome. I am one of the rare people who enjoys public speaking, and I love helping people learn about technology, so I was in heaven.

      The really surprising thing about
Functional JavaScript by Michael Fogus
is that it appears to target several audiences at once and seems to do
it well. If you are a JavaScript aficionado and you want to understand
functional programming, it works as an introduction. If you do a lot
of functional programming and want to learn how to program in
JavaScript without losing it, it works for that, too.

I see that it's quitting time, and what do I do? Unplug the keyboard and monitor from my shiny Mac and plug them into a tiny motherboard with a SD memory card sticking out of it, and boot up my Raspberry Pi, which has a fraction of the memory and processing power of the MacBook.
