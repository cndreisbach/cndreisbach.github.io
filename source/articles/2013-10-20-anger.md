summary: Being an angry programmer was funny when I was 25. It's not so much any more.

Last Friday, I saw the above message from my co-worker Marc come across Twitter. Of all my co-workers, Marc's the one I spend the most time talking to, and the one who knows me the best. I didn't know exactly what to think at first. It was kind of funny, and definitely correct, but I don't think of myself as this short-tempered angry guy.

It's not the first time I've had this reputation, and so it's obviously well-earned. I think I've had it at every job. One time, a guy I supervised told me I reminded him of the main character on "this new television show called _House_." I'd not seen it at the time, and so I asked "how so?" and he said, "well, he's very smart and no-nonsense." The poor guy did not tell me that also he is a jerk who is abusive to the people he supervises.

I don't want to be this guy. Most jobs that I've left, I left because I had some emotional moment where I lost my cool and then was embarrassed by it. I've never been asked to leave a job for any reason, which is unbelievable, given that one time I stood on top of a conference room table and told someone they were an idiot. (I was much, much younger and way more hot-headed than I am now.) Even though I was never asked to leave, I left many jobs because I didn't like that people thought of me as this emotional hot-head. It's the main reason I left an incredible job at [Viget Labs][] and another incredible job at [Relevance][]. It's one of the reasons the thought of leaving my current job crosses my mind often, and only my love of [my project][] has kept me from seriously considering it. I started going to therapy again because I don't want to quit my job, but was going to if I didn't get control over my anger.

I know I'm not the only person who suffers from this. I've met lots of people in my industry, usually of the same type: a hotshot known for "speaking honestly" and able to get away with being a smart-ass and a jerk because they are considered a good coder. If you are this guy or girl, it's probably fun, especially if you're under 30. You definitely get a lot of good laughs. Comedy is based in transgression, and so your own breaking of social norms cracks others up.

It's not as fun to be this person when you're approaching 40 and have a kid you want to be a good role model for. I look at the people I most respect in my field, and they are all of another type: quiet people who are ridiculously competent but humble about it and have a quick wit. Their wit is focused on being self-deprecrating instead of lashing out. As I get older, I want to be one of these people (not least because they are the majority of people who get to remain employed in this young person's field.)

When I was a kid, my dad told me two things I think about a lot. One was "son, you will never have a lot of friends." He meant because I think quickly and aren't at ease around other people, and he was right. It's a lot of the reason I get so angry: I don't understand why people are being what seems to me to be obtuse (but in actuality, I'm not taking the time to be empathic.) The other thing was "it takes a lifetime to build a good reputation and a minute to lose it." I doubt I'll ever be known as the humble friendly guy at my current job, but I'm going to try. My field has enough problems without me being a jerk, too.

**Postscript**: Lest Marc read this and think I didn't like his tweet, no worries. I _did_ like it, and not only is it zero stretch to imagine me having that conversation, I'm pretty sure I have had it. The tweet cracked me up; it also made me think.
