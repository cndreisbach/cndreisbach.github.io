I just got back from the
[15th O'Reilly Open Source Conference (OSCON)][oscon] in Portland,
Oregon. This is my fifth year going, I think, and it was as fun as
ever. This year, it was even more fun than usual because I got to see
so many friends there. I'm now working at home with a distributed team
and about a dozen of us showed up and got to hang out.

I really like OSCON because it is a dream for generalists. Most
conferences I go to focus on a particular technology, and OSCON is
scattershot, covering anything as long as it is open-source, or
related to open-source. This year, I was particularly excited to learn about
[Ansible][], [3D Javascript programming][3d-programming], and [Cascalog][].

One very exciting thing about this year's OSCON is the expansion of
talks about human interaction. During the half-day tutorials, there
was [one tutorial on game design][game-design], which I attended and
thought was great., and another on using improv techniques with your
team. Even more exciting to me was
[the session on depression][depression]. As a life-long sufferer of
depression, I'm glad any time I see it openly discussed. It has a
serious stigma about it that I think only open discussion will
alleviate.

While I did not get to attend the session
[Bash as a Modern Programming Language][bash], the slides are
wonderful and should be of interest to anyone who is a programmer,
especially on a Unix system.

On Wednesday night, I facilitated a Birds of a Feather session on
roleplaying games and how they have been influenced by open
culture. It was a fun time and I met many interesting people. We
talked a lot about [Dungeon World][] and the Old School Renaissance.

All in all, I had a great time. As always, I visited
[Powell's Books][powells] and have many books to read now. Thanks to
O'Reilly Media for such a great conference and I hope to see even more
friends next year. [Here are the slides for all the talks][slides],
which contain a wealth of knowledge.
